To get this set up:

1) Through the steam workshop, make sure you have BaseLib, StSLib (both should come with ModTheSpire I think)
2) Through the workshop, get "Communication Mod"
3) Checkout this repository, and clone it into the steam app folder in a new folder: `ai\requested_strike`. Ex: ` E:\Steam\steamapps\common\SlayTheSpire\ai\requested_strike`
4) Run the game with the mods enabled
5) Now your spire config file should be created: https://github.com/kiooeht/ModTheSpire/wiki/SpireConfig for how to navigate there
6) Add `command=python .\\ai\\requested_strike\\main.py` to the `config.properties` file there


Now it should all be able to run!
