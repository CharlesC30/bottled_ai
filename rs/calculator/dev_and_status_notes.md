This is where we'll keep the status of the calculator organized for a bit, what next steps are, total prio lists, etc.

### We are disregarding:

- card draw
- exhaust
- _anything_ random
- X cards

### KEY:

normal = okay

*italic* = to investigate

**bold** = we need to make adjustments for

~~strikethrough~~ = done

## RELICS AND STATUS TO DO

- ~~strike dummy~~
- ~~velvet choker~~
- ~~paper phrog~~
- ~~nunchaku~~
- ~~pen nib~~
- strength :: (already a spot for it)
- dexterity :: (do just like strength)
- artifact :: (if we only care about it for the enemy, we would just need to have some sort of debuff map to know which
  powers are debuffs, and then prevent the adding of those per charge...)
- plated armor :: (does depend on us implementing the turn resolve shit)
- vigor :: (basically goes where strength goes, then consumes itself)
- curl up :: (would be done inside the damage place of the enemies, I reckon)
- vulnerable :: done but still lacking the monsters attacking into it
- weak :: done but still lacking the monsters attacking with it
- entangled :: (a check on this in the get plays and attack type should be easy)
- frail :: (just some additional logic in the block)

## CARDS TO DO
