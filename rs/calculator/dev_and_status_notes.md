This is where we'll keep the status of the calculator organized for a bit, what next steps are, total prio lists, etc.


So the concept for card draw...
We'll create a new "card_draw" card. Would be great if we could give it an internal stat for
"How much energy it had left" (though we could also just create 4 new cards for 3+, 2, 1, 0)...
Card draw will give you those into your hand.

Yeah, let's just do 4 different cards for right now, because that will fit best in it.
